1. Create an angular app
2. create another component: registration component. It will be nested component.
	through the form in the design accept following values from user:
	a. name
	b. username
	c. password
	d. retype password
	e. mobile no
	on the form place a button to submit the complete form data
	(for testing pupose just print the form values in the console: name, password, username and mobile no)

	register the component in the app module
	nest the component in app.component.html file

3. this form data which is part of the registration component, should be passed to the app component and display the registration form data (name, password, username and mobile no) in the console using a method of App component

note: create the registration component using Reactive Form style (try also template-driven form)

4. validate the input elements on the registration component

5. create another component in the same application: Confirmation component and pass the data, that App component has received from registration component, to this new confirmation component, where you display the values (name, password, username, mobile no)
