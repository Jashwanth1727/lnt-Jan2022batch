1. create a class (do it in separate class file) for employee, where
   data: name, id, basic salary, project name and location
	Note: id and name should be assigned only through constructor
   functionality: function to return information (name, salary, project name) about an object

2. create properties for all data members, where "id" and "name" should be read-only properties
3. also create 1 default constructor
4. also create 2 parameterized constructors: one which will accept id and name values (for id and name data member) and another which will accept all value ( for all data members)
the parameterized constructor will accept all the values for an employee object
