calulate the area of different shapes: circle and triangle

which one should  be base? a concrete class or an abstract class or an interface

Circle:
	data members: radius
	property: Radius
	ctor: default and parameterized ctor with one parameter
	methods: double CalculateArea()

Triangle:
	data members: tBase, tHeight
	properties: TBase, THeight
	ctor: default and parameterized ctor with two parameters
	methods: double CalculateArea()

create a console application 
create object of shapes based on user choice  (one each of every shape)
1. Circle
2. Triangle
Enter choice[1/2]: __1__

ask user to enter value for data members of the shape
enter radius: 12

calculate the area and display the same
area of circle is:
