UDF allows only select statements		allows select + DML statements
must have a return value			not necessary to return value
there is no output parameter			you can use output parameter too
can be used with where/having/select		can't be used with where/having/select
try..catch block can't be used in UDF		try..catch can be used in here
UDF can be called from stored procedure		procedures can't be called from UDF

---------------------
a view is alogical collection of tables in SQL Server which is stored in SQL Server database.
practically view is virtual table, i.e. this table does not exist in reality, but created as a result of joining the tables
