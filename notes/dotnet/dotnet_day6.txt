Exception handling:

Errors:
a. compilation error
b. runtime error
	you have written such a code, that system/runtime can't execute
	runtime stops execution of your code
	an object of appropriate exception class is created by runtime, which is populated with lots of information about the issue
	the runtime passes (throws) the reference of that object to the application
	
what you neec to do in your code?
	you need to write your suspected code (the code which you suspect that might throw error or cause issue) inside try block and followed by catch block to catch the reference of the exception object thrown by runtime


				Exception 
data members: message, stackTrace, source, targetSite, lineNumber etc.
properties: Message, StackTrace, Source, TargetSite, LineNumber etc.
