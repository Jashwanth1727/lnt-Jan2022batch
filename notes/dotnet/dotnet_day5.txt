polymorphism: same name, different form

A. compile time polymorphism: during compilation, compiler connects the caller line with the appropriate function to call (which function will be called is decided during compilation time)

example: function overloading, constructor overloading, operator overloading

i. function (also constructor) overloading: function (including constructor) with same name but diffence in the arguments
	- No of parameters/arguments
	- arguments with different data types
	- order of the arguments

ii. operator overloading: same operator working on different operands and do different kind of jobs (adding ,concatenting etc.)
example: 
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int res = a + b; //+ operator is adding two integers

string firstName = "Sunil";
string lastName = "Kumar";
string fullName = firstName+lastName; //+ operator is concatenating two strings
